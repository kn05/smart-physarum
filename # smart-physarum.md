# smart-physarum
This project is a simulation of the model from Lecture#8-smart_Physarum in the Biophysics(PHYS491-00).

Here are the results of the simulation. The transparency of the scatter represents the relative magnitude of the pressure in the model, and the thickness of the line is proportional to the conductivity. The red line indicates a small risk factor, and the blue line indicates a large risk factor.
